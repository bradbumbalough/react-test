# React Test
A simple React app to test competencies.

> React is a JavaScript library for creating user interfaces. Its core principles are declarative code, efficiency, and flexibility. Simply specify what your component looks like and React will keep it up-to-date when the underlying data changes.

## Objectives
The goal is to turn this basic, non-optomized app into a React efficient and functional app.

1. Restructure into components
2. Implement state/props
3. (Bonus) Implement Bootstrap for styling

## Running

Clone the repo to your local system. Navigate to the folder in your terminal or command prompt. Run `npm start` to fire up the node server on localhost. Then, go to `http://localhost:3000/` to access the app.
